A few months ago, I was looking for a Telegram bot that would send me random dog and cat pictures. I found a few, but they were not very good. So I decided to make my own.

The idea is to send a random picture from a subreddit, depending on the command. For example, `/woof` will send a random picture of a dog, and `/meow` will send a random picture of a cat.

The bot is written in Python, and uses the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library.

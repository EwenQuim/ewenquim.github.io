## What is it ?

It's a website with recipe recommendations for the week (not only the day).

Most websites just recommend one recipe. But I want **all** the week so the meals are balanced (and to get the shopping list), so I made my own algorithm.

## Screenshots

None for the moment. I'm rebuilding the interface.

## Details

Made with Django in Python. I'll do it again with Go, for performance, one day.

I'm building an app in React Native for the project.

Coalescence - my journey

## The story

Coalescence is my first serious project. Even if it began very badly.

It's not my first experience at creating video game. I already used a lot RPG Maker before, and that's what bring me into software development. I just wanted to make games and show them to people that matter to me.

## Achievements

I used 3 text editors, from Editra to VS Code. 

I discovered Git with this project (and my first `git rebase -i`)

I also discovered Github, along with GH Actions (automation, CI/CD), GH Projects (project management).

I hired a graphist and a translator.

It is a 10k+ lines project (and it keeps growing), with all the challenges that comes with organization.

I discovered Python and variables, and learned (the hard way) how to organize them in more efficient data structures (classes, dicts, lists...).

I created my own tool (the Renpy Visualizer, see [Projects](/projects)) to help organize the story.

I learned basics of story telling.

Coalescence - my journey as a developper.

## The story

Coalescence is my first serious project. Even if it began very badly. It's the project I began coding with, and I'm still working on it today !

It's not my first experience at creating video game. I already used a lot RPG Maker before, but it's the forst time I coded for _real_. I didn't began to code for the sake of it, but as a tool. That's what bring me into software development : I just want to create stories and share them with people that matter to me. The means doesn't matter, the product and its impact does.

## Achievements

I used 3 text editors, Editra to VS Code. 

I discovered (and messed up with) Git with this project (and my first `git rebase -i`).

I also discovered Github, along with GH Actions (automation, CI/CD), GH Projects (project management).

I hired a graphist and a translator.

It is a 10k+ lines project (and it keeps growing), with all the challenges that comes with organization.

I discovered Python and variables, and learned (the hard way) how to organize them in more efficient data structures (classes, dicts, lists...).

As the project grew, I had to create my own tools (the Renpy Visualizer, see [Projects](/projects)) to help organize the story.

I learned basics of story telling.
